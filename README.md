# Voxel Thing

Me messing around with voxels and OpenGL.

Built with OpenGL + Glad + C.

## Dependencies

Just GLFW.

## Building

```sh
cmake -Bbuild && cmake --build build
```

## Running
```sh
./build/main
```

## Usage

WASD to move. Space to go up, shift to go down (like Minecraft).
Escape closes the window.
Z to toggle the mouse.
